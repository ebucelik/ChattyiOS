# Chatty

Chatty is a small social media app where users can post pictures, subscribe friends & family and chat with new subscribed people. The motto is „make privacy great again“.

1 year ago it was just an idea on a whiteboard and now its reality. The main goal of this project was the self-improvement.

Used tech stack
- Frontend: Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, TCA, OneSignal
- Backend: Kotlin, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Maven, Socket.IO
- Deployed on a VPS (virtual private server)

This is my 4th app on the App Store (first 2 were removed due to legacy iOS versions) that I have released.
Chatty is a social media platform where it is possible to find, subscribe and chat with friends, family and new people.
No public accounts anymore! Everyone is private and has the control over the privacy.
